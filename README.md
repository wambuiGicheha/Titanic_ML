# Titanic Dataset for Machine Learning

## Overview

The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset for machine learning projects and competitions, such as Kaggle’s
“Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster.” It contains information about passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, 
which sank on April 15, 1912, after colliding with an iceberg. The dataset is commonly used for binary classification tasks, 
with the goal of predicting whether a passenger survived or not based on various features

## Dataset Contents

The Titanic dataset comes in two CSV files:
	1.	train.csv: Used for training a machine learning model. It contains both features and the target variable (Survived).
	2.	test.csv: Used for testing model predictions. It contains the same features as the training set, except for the Survived column

Features

Below are the columns found in the dataset:

Column Name	Description	Data Type	Example Values
PassengerId	Unique identifier for each passenger	Integer	1, 2, 3
Survived	Survival status (target variable): 0 = Did not survive, 1 = Survived	Integer	0, 1
Pclass	Ticket class: 1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd	Integer	1, 2, 3
Name	Name of the passenger	String	“Braund, Mr. Owen Harris”
Sex	Gender of the passenger	String	“male”, “female”
Age	Age of the passenger in years (some values are missing)	Float	22, 38, NaN
SibSp	Number of siblings/spouses aboard	Integer	0, 1, 2
Parch	Number of parents/children aboard	Integer	0, 1, 2
Ticket	Ticket number	String	“A/5 21171”, “PC 17599”
Fare	Ticket price	Float	7.25, 71.2833, 8.05
Cabin	Cabin number (many missing values)	String	“C85”, “B28”, NaN
Embarked	Port of embarkation: C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton	String	“C”, “Q”, “S”, NaN


Goal

The main objective is to predict the Survived column (0 or 1) based on the other features. This involves:
	1.	Data cleaning and preprocessing.
	2.	Exploratory data analysis (EDA).
	3.	Feature engineering (e.g., dealing with missing values, creating new features).
	4.	Building classification models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, etc.).

Preprocessing Tips
	1.	Handle Missing Values:
	•	Age, Cabin, and Embarked contain missing data. Consider imputation strategies.
	2.	Feature Encoding:
	•	Convert categorical variables like Sex and Embarked into numerical format using techniques such as one-hot encoding.
	3.	Scaling:
	•	Normalize numerical features like Age and Fare for models sensitive to feature scaling.
	4.	Feature Selection:
	•	Some features like PassengerId and Ticket may not add predictive value and can be excluded.

Example Use Cases
	•	Binary Classification: Predict survival probability for passengers.
	•	Feature Engineering: Explore new features such as family size (SibSp + Parch + 1) or title extraction from the Name column.
	•	Model Comparison: Compare different machine learning models for performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
