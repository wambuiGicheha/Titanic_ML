# Titanic Survival Analysis

This project analyzes the Titanic disaster dataset to identify key factors influencing passenger survival rates. By employing data analysis and machine learning techniques, we aim to uncover patterns and insights that determined survival during the tragedy.

## Project Overview

The sinking of the Titanic in 1912 is one of the most infamous maritime disasters in history. Understanding the characteristics of the passengers who survived versus those who did not can provide valuable insights into the socio-economic and demographic factors at play during the evacuation. This project utilizes the Titanic dataset to perform exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and predictive modeling to determine the likelihood of survival based on various features.

## Installation
To run this project locally, ensure you have Python installed. Clone the repository and install the required packages using pip:

 git clone https://github.com/yourusername/titanic-survival-analysis.git

cd titanic-survival-analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt

The requirements.txt file includes all necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.

## Usage
After installation, you can run the analysis scripts or Jupyter notebooks provided in the repository. For example, to start the Jupyter notebook:


	jupyter notebook titanic_analysis.ipynb

This will open the notebook in your default web browser, allowing you to interact with the code, visualize data, and understand the step-by-step process of the analysis.

## Dataset_Contents

The Titanic dataset comes in two CSV files:
	1.	train.csv: Used for training a machine learning model. It contains both features and the target variable (Survived).

	2.	test.csv: Used for testing model predictions. It contains the same features as the training set, except for the Survived column

## Features

Below are the columns found in the dataset:

## Column Name	Description	Data Type	Example Values

PassengerId	Unique identifier for each passenger	Integer	1, 2, 3

Survived	Survival status (target variable): 0 = Did not survive, 1 = Survived	Integer	0, 1

Pclass	Ticket class: 1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd	Integer	1, 2, 3

Name	Name of the passenger	String	“Braund, Mr. Owen Harris”

Sex	Gender of the passenger	String	“male”, “female”

Age	Age of the passenger in years (some values are missing)	Float	22, 38, NaN

SibSp	Number of siblings/spouses aboard	Integer	0, 1, 2

Parch	Number of parents/children aboard	Integer	0, 1, 2

Ticket	Ticket number	String	“A/5 21171”, “PC 17599”

Fare	Ticket price	Float	7.25, 71.2833, 8.05

Cabin	Cabin number (many missing values)	String	“C85”, “B28”, NaN

Embarked	Port of embarkation: C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton	String	“C”, “Q”, “S”, NaN


## Goal

The main objective is to predict the Survived column (0 or 1) based on the other features. This involves:

	1.	Data cleaning and preprocessing.
 
	2.	Exploratory data analysis (EDA).
 
	3.	Feature engineering (e.g., dealing with missing values, creating new features).
 
	4.	Building classification models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, etc.).

	5. Insights Extraction: Deriving meaningful conclusions from the analysis.

## Preprocessing Steps
	1.	Handle Missing Values:
	•	Age, Cabin, and Embarked contain missing data. Consider imputation strategies.
	2.	Feature Encoding:
	•	Convert categorical variables like Sex and Embarked into numerical format using techniques such as one-hot encoding.
	3.	Scaling:
	•	Normalize numerical features like Age and Fare for models sensitive to feature scaling.
	4.	Feature Selection:
	•	Some features like PassengerId and Ticket may not add predictive value and can be excluded.
	5. 	Binary Classification: Predict survival probability for passengers.
	6. 	Feature Engineering: Explore new features such as family size (SibSp + Parch + 1) or title extraction from the Name column.
	7. 	Model Comparison: Compare different machine learning models for performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
